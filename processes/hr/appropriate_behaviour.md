Appropriate Behaviour
=======================

While we've had a great deal of luck with everyone on our team being very respectful, over time there's always the chance that an individual or a group is not. 

Your first course of action, should be to speak to the current CEO. As we grow, this will be replaced with an HR representative.

If you do not feel comfortable coming forward in person, then we've also provided an anonymous form where you can voice your concern. You can find the form here: http://goo.gl/forms/yWohi8bbHG

Your concern will be addressed. We care about you feeling comfortable and happy in your workplace.
